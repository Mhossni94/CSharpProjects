#This was my graduation project, The embedeed Hardware Made by Sherif Hosny 

Briefly Description: 

Hardware: 
CNC Machine that use a new concept of coordinates which is a hybird between Polar coordinates & cartesian Cordinates which allowed to 
us in the design to decrease the mechanical components that's resulted a low cost machine and portability. 

Software: 
It's a basic CNC Controlling app, That uses Serial port to send to the machine the points aquired from the G-Code, That was generated 
using normal CadCam Application, or you can use the app for jogging and calibrating the machine
